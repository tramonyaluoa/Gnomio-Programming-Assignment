# Gnomio-Programming-Assignment

Write a program to prompt the user for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print/output a grade using the following table:



>= 0.9      A

>= 0.8      B

>= 0.7      C

>= 0.6      D

< 0.6       F



Step 1: write a program to prompt for a number and then print that number

Step 2: write a program that gives error message if score is out of range and prints the number is score is in range

Step 3: as in the original instruction, print a grade according to Score Grade

Step 4: add try ... except (or "try catch" statements in JS) statements that print the grade if the input is not null and is numeric and between 0 and 1, else gives helpful error message ("input must not be null / must be a number")
